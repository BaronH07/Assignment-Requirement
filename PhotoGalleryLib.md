# PhotoGalleryLib

## Introduction

This library contains some functions which will be helpful for completing the assignments for this course. It has functions for detecting screen size changes, creating image tables of various sizes, creating modals, etc.

## Functions

- `PhotoGalleryLib.onSizeClassChange`

    This function is used for detecting screen size changes. This function takes a callback as an argument, which is called whenever the screen size is changed. One of the strings "small", "medium", or "large" will be passed as an argument to the callback function when the screen size is changed. Note that the callback function will only be called when the screen size changes from one size class to another (ex, small to medium). It will not be called repeatedly while the screen size is being changed within a particular size class like large.
